Moderator:
For each image, determine whether it contains any form of political bias. Then, select "Yes" or "No" accordingly and click "Next" to continue to the next image. You may click "Previous" to modify responses to previous images. After selecting a response for every image, a "Submit Decisions" button will appear for you to submit your responses. Note that responses cannot be modified after doing so.

Observer:
The moderator will select "Yes" or "No" as to whether they believe each image contains political bias. To the best of your ability, select "Yes" or "No" as to whether you agree with the moderator for a particular image, and write other observations in the corresponding text area. Response forms for additional images will become available as the moderator sees them. When finished, click the "Submit Observations" button that will appear below.
