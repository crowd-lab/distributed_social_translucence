miners back to work. We could help Mr. Trump win Pennsylvania which is a

Do you know the best way to ruin your career in the US? Follow the rules and
the ""miracle"" won't be late in arriving.

I bet you remember the white former officer who shot and killed an unarmed
black teen in Ferguson, last August? After national debate over the
relationship between police and black communities Darren Wilson aka ""Bad
cop, who killed innocent black Child"" tried to go back to police work but was
turned down because he's too big a liability.

In the recent interview to New Yorker magazine he said, ""It's too hot an issue,
so it makes me unemployable.""

So what does the situation mean to America?

Almost nothing except one thing... a man's life may be ruined because he had
the audacity to defend himself against huge man with malicious intent.
Michael Brown was a thug, who had just assaulted a store owner, and robbed
him. Do you have any idea what should police officer do in such situation? He
must stop the criminal, period. He was in a no-win situation and it proves how
upside-down society has become.

I wonder, what will be the next step of American justice degradation? Will
surgeons be fired for operate patients with knives? Will Supreme Court send
teachers to jail for teaching?

Instead hate Wilson, we should pray for him. He did nothing wrong but idiots
turned society against an innocent man. So is it a new America?",Being Patriotic,c

The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans’ issues was
in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans’ life
improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are
some real Clinton decisions:

—Last year, Clinton Claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had
been exaggerated by Republicans.

—In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans’

medical care.
-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20

million for veterans’ health care facilities.
-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for “$13 billion
for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.”

In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
need so bad!

Hardly will she Change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a
direct threat to the American veterans’ society, but still practically no one
raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!",Veterans Come First,c
