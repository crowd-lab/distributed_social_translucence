    <p>We are building a new online community, and given the recent news about foreign governments
interfering in elections through targeted political content, we have decided we do not want
political content in our community.</p>
    <p>Therefore, we would like your help to test this out, and moderate images being shared to exclude
political content.</p>
    <p>To make sure this moderation is fair, your process may be observed. If you are observed, you will
see other cursors on the screen. These observations will not influence your compensation for this
task.</p>
    <p>We may ask you to serve as an observer as well, and record your observations of others doing the
moderation task. As we said before, these observations will not impact the compensation of the
people doing the moderation, we just want to understand the moderation process.</p>
